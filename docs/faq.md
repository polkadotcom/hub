## Is this an official Web3 Foundation website?

No, the Polkadot.com hub (Polkahub) is a community-run website intended to provide knowledge and
tools necessary to effectively navigate and use the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystem, collectively
known as "Dotsama".

## What services will this website offer?

This is not a service website - it is a free resource by the community for the community. The
content on this website will be educational, geared towards non-technical users, with a separate
section for developers on how to get started building user-focused Web3 applications for Dotsama. We
also intend to publish various videos, tutorials, and podcasts as part of the knowledgebase.

Polkadot.com has also absorbed the popular [Dot Leap Newsletter](https://newsletter.dotleap.com),
which you can subscribe to to be kept up to date with both Polkadot.com developments, and
developments in the Polkadot ecosystem at large.

## Is this a paid website?

This is not a paid website. You will never need to pay to access any content on this website.
