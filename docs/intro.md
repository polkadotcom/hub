## Welcome to Polkahub

This documentation is intended to be your guide through the Dotsama (Polkadot and Kusama) universe.
We try to keep the documentation as beginner-friendly as possible.

There are several sections in the left sidebar - please explore each based on your interests.
There's also a very comprehensive search integrated into the application - see the top right corner.
Any term you're searching for should be there.

If at any point you get stuck, something doesn't make sense, or some instructions or explanations
are unclear, please reach out [via email](mailto:contact@polkadot.com).
